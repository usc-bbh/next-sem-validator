# STARS Parser

Parses a USC STARS degree progress report PDF into a structured JSON object.
Built for Module 1 of the TrojanReg project.

## How it works

Two approaches, tried in order:

1. Direct text extraction via PDF.js — works for PDFs downloaded from my.usc.edu
2. OCR via Tesseract.js — fallback for scanned copies (e.g. registrar-provided anonymized reports)

If both fail, returns null so the UI can prompt the student to fill in their info manually.

Everything runs client-side. Nothing is sent to a server.

## Output

}
```

## Usage

```js
import { parseStarsReport } from "./stars-parser";

const result = await parseStarsReport(file, {
  onStatus: (msg) => console.log(msg),
  onProgress: (page, total) => console.log(`OCR: ${page}/${total}`),
});

if (!result) {
  // prompt manual entry
}
```

## Dependencies

- pdfjs-dist
- tesseract.js

## Tests

Run the test suite with:

```
node stars-parser/test/parser.test.js
```

Tests all 10 sample reports against known ground truth — major, GPA, transfer units, flags, minors etc. No dependencies needed to run it.

The test uses pre-generated fixtures so the sample PDFs are not required to run it. If you want the original PDFs, download them from the shared Google Drive and place them in `stars-parser/test/samples/`.
